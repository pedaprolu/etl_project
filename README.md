ETL Data Pipeline Project
his project is an ETL data pipeline that automates moving and preparing data for analysis.

1)Extract: Data is pulled from AWS S3 where raw files are stored.
2)Transform: Using Python (pandas), the data is cleaned, formatted, and processed to match the analysis requirements.
3)Load: The transformed data is loaded into a PostgreSQL database for structured storage.
 Visualization: The PostgreSQL data is then connected to Power BI to create interactive dashboards and reports.
This setup makes it easy to handle large datasets, keep data consistent, and update visualizations automatically whenever new data arrives in S3

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline built in Python to automate data ingestion, cleaning, and storage for analytics.

Itâ€™s designed with scalability and modularity in mind, so each step of the pipeline can be reused or replaced depending on the data source and target system.

ðŸš€ Features
Extract data from APIs, CSV/Excel, or databases.
Transform data using pandas (cleaning, formatting, business logic).
Load into a PostgreSQL database for reporting & dashboards.
Logging for pipeline monitoring and debugging.
Modular scripts for easy updates.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, requests

Database: PostgreSQL
