ETL Data Pipeline Project

ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates an Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) pipeline built in Python to automate data ingestion, cleaning, and storage for analytics.

Itâ€™s designed with scalability and modularity in mind, so each step of the pipeline can be reused or replaced depending on the data source and target system.

ðŸš€ Features
Extract data from APIs, CSV/Excel, or databases.
Transform data using pandas (cleaning, formatting, business logic).
Load into a PostgreSQL database for reporting & dashboards.
Logging for pipeline monitoring and debugging.
Modular scripts for easy updates.

ðŸ›  Tech Stack
Language: Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, requests

Database: PostgreSQL
